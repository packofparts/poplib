Welcome to POPLib documentation!
===================================

**POPLib** is a FRC Java library that uses Vendor API's and WPILIB to make FRC robot programming easy.
It allows for the easy and safe creation of basic hardware components, such as Motors, Gyros, BeamBreak Sensors, Photonvision Cameras, Limelight Cameras, etc.
POPLib also includes subsystem bases so that the programming of more complex subsystems such as Swerve, Elevators, Pivots, Intakes, etc. are simple. 

Check out the :doc:`installation` section to get started with installing POPLib.

   This documentation is for POPLibv2, which is in active development and the first production release will be before 2026.
